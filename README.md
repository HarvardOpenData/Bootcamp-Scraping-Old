# Scraping Bootcamp

This is the repository for HODP's Data Scraping Bootcamp.

### Here's what you need to do:
1. Ignore `demo_scraping.ipynb`, that's for us to demonstrate what scraping looks like, you don't need to change anything there!
2. Open [regex101.com](regex101.com) and copy the text from `sample_text.txt` into the test string box.
3. Make sure your flavour (on the left hand side of the page) is set to Python.
4. Feel free to refer to the useful reesources listed below during the bootcamp!

### Helpful resources
1. Regex reference sheet: https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html or http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html#ref
2. Most of the Regex lessons were taken from [here](https://regexone.com/), definitely return to them if you need a refresher/want more lessons.
3. Great [tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/web-scraping-using-python) on how to use BeautifulSoup
